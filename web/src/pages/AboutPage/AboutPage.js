      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        In 2021 I started coding as a hobby, and soon realised
        <em> &apos;holy moly, this is great!&apos;.</em> It became clear that I
        did indeed have a knack for (and love of) logic and problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        After years of feeling unsure about what impactful career I could fall
        in love with, it clicked for me that software development could be my
        one way ticket. I feel excited about being part of the solution and
        building cool things.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to actively combat social and environmental issues through
        building useful and elegant tech solutions. I believe that meaningful
        change happens when inclusion, communication and kindness are are
        central values.
      </p>
      <p>
        My stack is built on Node.js, React, Redux and Express. My testing suite
        includes TestingLibrary, Jest and Supertest. I&apos;m working on some
        cool personal and group projects at the moment. Head to the Projects
        page for more info on those.
