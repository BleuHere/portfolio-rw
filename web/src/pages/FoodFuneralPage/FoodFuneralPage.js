        In a team of four, we collaboratively planned, designed, coded and
        tested a full-stack app in less than a week. This short-deadline, high
        intensity project allowed me to hone both my technical and human skills.

        I speak at 4.45, but the whole presentation is informative and
        demonstrates the scope and implementation of the project.

      <h2>Human Takeaways</h2>

      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          We created a wellbeing-first team culture. This was intentional - we
          built processes that would encourage taking rests, giving feedback,
          and having fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          We were highly collaborative, and did awesome planning. We set
          personal learning objectives, and planned and designed our app
          together and did lots of pair programming. This made the
          implementation of our project simple and enjoyable.
        </li>
        <li>
          I had a really wonderful team experience, and felt that because of our
          team culture I could relax, enjoy the code, and trust my teammates.
          Experiencing this great environment makes me excited to cultivate, and
          contribute to this type of environment in the workplace.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tech Takeaways</h2>
      <img src="test.png" alt="a screenshot of 40 tests passing" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          We worked on full-stack tickets which gave me a comprehensive
          understanding of how each module talks to one another. This was super
          valuable to my learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          With less than a week to complete this project, we chose a simple MVP
          and decided we wanted to do lots of testing. I learnt a lot about how
          the code works through testing and we managed to test 87% of our code
          base!
        </li>
        <li>
          The fact that we chose a simple MVP also allowed us to be curious and
          explore while we coded. This made the experience much more enjoyable,
          but also I learnt much more than if we had needed to crunch code 24/7
          to complete the MVP.
